Spring:
    Spring is a open source light weight java based framework.Using spring framework we can develope several typeof java application like standalone app,wed Application,
Distributed Application.Spring is a non-Invasive,Versatile and it is developed in modular fashion.
Beans:
    @Bean annotation is method level annotation.If we want to create object for any class with our own implementation then we will use @Bean annotation.
The method which is annotated with @Bean will be called by IOC.
components:
    @Component is a stereo type annotation which is used to represent java class is Spring Bean.This is a class level annotation.
Spring IOC:
    It is principle which is used to manage and collaborate Dependencies among the object in application.It is responsible to perform Dependency Injection.
Dependecy Injection:
    The process of injecting dependent bean object into target bean object is called Dependency Injection.
Maven project:
    Maven is a widely used build automation and project management tool in the Java software development ecosystem.
It helps manage the entire lifecycle of a software project, including tasks such as building, testing, packaging, and managing dependencies. 
Annotations:
      an annotation is a form of metadata that provides additional information about elements in the code.
Annotations in programming languages are used to add descriptive or structural information to the source code, and they are typically not involved in the program's execution.
Spring mvc:
      Spring MVC is one of the module available in spring framework.Using spring MVC we can develop Web Application and Distributed Application.
Spring MVC architecture contain component:1)FrontController
                                          2)HandlerMapper
                                          3)Controller
                                          4)ModelAndView
                                          5)ViewResolver
                                          6)View

ORM:
  OMR stands for Object Relational Mapping.When we working with Data Jpa we can few ORM properties like Show_sql=true,format_sql,ddl_auto=update/create/validate.

Security:
  Spring Security is a powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework for Java applications. 
It is a part of the larger Spring framework and provides comprehensive security services for Java EE-based enterprise software applications. 
Spring Security can be integrated with various authentication mechanisms, authorization strategies, and protection against common security vulnerabilities

Spring AOP:
     Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. 
Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple modules, and traditional object-oriented programming can lead to code duplication or tangling when addressing these concerns. 
Spring AOP provides a way to modularize these concerns.

CRUDÂ operations:
     Spring application, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations involves interacting with a data source, such as a database, and manipulating data. 
Example:
   public User updateUser(Long userId, User updatedUser) {
        User existingUser = userRepository.findById(userId).orElse(null);
        
        if (existingUser != null) {
            existingUser.setUsername(updatedUser.getUsername());
            existingUser.setEmail(updatedUser.getEmail());
            
            return userRepository.save(existingUser);
        }
        return null;
    }
}
